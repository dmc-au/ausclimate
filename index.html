            The world is heating up, and so is Australia. The gif below is an amalgamation
            of the Beareau of Meteorology's Mean Temperature Anomaly maps from 1911 to 2022.

            We know we're a competitive bunch, and the world knows that too, especially
            when it comes to sport. Between 1896 and 2016, Australian's have been on the
            podium 1,320 times, ranking Australia 9th in the world for medal count. That's
            an incredible given the size of our country.
        </p>

        <p>
            But we're not competitive when it comes to climate change. According to the
            Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), Australia currently ranks 59th. In 2022
            we <i>fell</i> 5 ranks. We're now below the United States (55th) and Russia (56th),
            and <i>well</i> below China (38th) and many other first world nations.

        <p>
            My hope in writing this article is to visualise and communicate our current state of
            affairs when it comes to climate, and to call on the Australian spirit to be
            more competitive in this space.
        </p>

        <p>
            The CCPI has specifically <i>not</i> awarded a top 3 (podium) place to any country
            in its index ranking system since 2008, reasoning that <i>"No country is doing enough 
            to prevent dangerous climate change."</i> This is an incredible opportunity for
            Australia to step it up and be the leader in what's largely considered the world's 
            biggest problem today.
        </p>

        <p>
            The challenge is a big one. Over the past roughly 30 years, Australian citizens have,
            on average, consumed 2.8 times more energy than the global average citizen, and have
            contributed as much as a staggering 5 times more in greenhouse emissions.
        </p>

            <h3 class="big-number-header">Average Australian Energy Consumption</h2>

            One positive aspect to the story is that we are closing in on the world average
            proportion of renewables in our energy mix. Since 1990, our renewables proportion
            has been half of that of the world average.
