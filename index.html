            The world is heating up, and so is Australia. The gif below is an amalgamation
            of the Beareau of Meteorology's Mean Temperature Anomaly maps from 1911 to 2022.

        <p>
            We know we're a competitive bunch, and the world knows that too, especially
            when it comes to sport. Between 1896 and 2016, Australian's have been on the
            podium 1,320 times, ranking Australia 9th in the world for medal count. That's
            an incredible given the size of our country.
        </p>

        <p>
            But we're not competitive when it comes to climate change. According to the
            Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), Australia currently ranks 59th. In 2022
            we <i>fell</i> 5 ranks. We're now below the United States (55th) and Russia (56th),
            and <i>well</i> below China (38th) and many other first world nations.

            My hope in writing this article is to visualise and communicate our current state of
            affairs when it comes to climate, and to call on the Australian spirit to be
            more competitive in this space.
        </p>

        <p>
            The CCPI has specifically <i>not</i> awarded a top 3 (podium) place to any country
            in its index ranking system since 2008, reasoning that <i>"No country is doing enough 
            to prevent dangerous climate change."</i> This is an incredible opportunity for
            Australia to step it up and be the leader in what's largely considered the world's 
            biggest problem today.
        </p>

        <p>
            The challenge is a big one. Over the past roughly 30 years, Australian citizens have,
            on average, consumed 2.8 times more energy than the global average citizen, and have
            contributed as much as a staggering 5 times more in greenhouse emissions.
        </p>

        <div class="big-number-container">
            <h3 class="big-number-header">Average Australian Energy Consumption</h2>
            <p class="big-number">2.8x</p>
        </div>

            <p class="big-number">5x</p>

        <div class="graph-container">

        <p>
            One positive aspect to the story is that we are closing in on the world average
            proportion of renewables in our energy mix, which was otherwise only half of
            the world's average.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="big-number-container">
            <h3 class="big-number-header">Average Australian Renewables Proportion</h2>
            <p class="big-number">1/2</p>

        <div class="graph-container">
            <canvas id="renewables" class="graph"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Another is the uptake of small-scale renewable energy sources as a result of
            favourable government policies. This shows that Australians are motivated to
            do the right thing if financially incentivised.
        </p>

            <canvas id="battery" class="graph"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this isn't making much of a dent. Australia's energy is still
            largely produced and consumed by industry. Our total corporate emissions were
            a whopping 395,889,583,000 kilograms of CO2 in the year of 2021.

            That's almost 100 times the weight of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament#:~:text=The%20Palace%20of%20the%20Parliament%20is%20the%20heaviest%20building%20in,is%20about%2050%25%20heavier.)">
            world's heaviest building</a> worth of greenhouse gasses being released
            into the atmosphere from Australia every year.

            We must step up our game and do our part in saving the world. We can all play a part,
            and together earn the gold medal in climate action. Popular figures
            in Australia, like sporting stars, can help by raising awareness of the severity
            of the issue. Aussie battlers at home need to feel empowered that they can make a 
            difference, and they can. As citizens we can all contribute by consuming less,
            and by consuming more sustainably. Business and governmental leaders have the biggest
            ability to make change. What greater achievement could you achieve than to catapult
            Australia to first place in your respective industry?
